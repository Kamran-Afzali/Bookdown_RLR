# Function Approximation Q-Learning with Linear Models

## Introduction

In reinforcement learning (RL), tabular methods like SARSA and
Q-Learning store a separate Q-value for each state-action pair, which
becomes infeasible in large or continuous state spaces. Function
approximation addresses this by representing the action-value function
$Q(s, a)$ as a parameterized function $Q(s, a; \theta)$, enabling
generalization across states and scalability. This post explores
Q-Learning with linear function approximation, using a 10-state,
2-action environment to demonstrate how it learns policies compared to
tabular methods. We provide mathematical formulations, R code, and
comparisons with tabular Q-Learning, focusing on generalization,
scalability, and practical implications.

Function approximation in RL aims to estimate the action-value function:

$$
Q^\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_{t+1} \mid S_0 = s, A_0 = a \right]
$$

where $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is the discount factor, and $R_{t+1}$ is the
reward at time $t+1$. Instead of storing $Q(s, a)$ in a table, we
approximate it as:

$$
Q(s, a; \theta) = \phi(s, a)^T \theta
$$

where $\phi(s, a)$ is a feature vector for state-action pair $(s, a)$,
and $\theta$ is a parameter vector learned via optimization, typically
stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

### Q-Learning with Function Approximation

Q-Learning with function approximation is an off-policy method that
learns the optimal policy by updating $\theta$ to minimize the temporal
difference (TD) error. The update rule is:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \delta \nabla_\theta Q(s, a; \theta)
$$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and the TD error $\delta$ is:

$$
\delta = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta) - Q(s, a; \theta)
$$

Here, $r$ is the reward, $s'$ is the next state, and
$\max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta)$ estimates the value of the next state
assuming the optimal action. For linear function approximation, the
gradient is:

$$
\nabla_\theta Q(s, a; \theta) = \phi(s, a)
$$

Thus, the update becomes:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta) - Q(s, a; \theta) \right) \phi(s, a)
$$

In our 10-state environment, we use one-hot encoding for $\phi(s, a)$,
mimicking tabular Q-Learning for simplicity but demonstrating the
framework’s potential for generalization with more complex features.

### Comparison with Tabular Q-Learning

Tabular Q-Learning updates a table of Q-values directly:

$$
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
$$

Function approximation generalizes across states via $\phi(s, a)$,
reducing memory requirements and enabling learning in large or
continuous spaces. However, it introduces approximation errors and
requires careful feature design to ensure convergence.

| **Aspect** | **Tabular Q-Learning** | **Q-Learning with Function Approximation** |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Representation** | Table of $Q(s, a)$ values | $Q(s, a; \theta) = \phi(s, a)^T \theta$ |
| **Memory** | $O(|\mathcal{S}| \cdot |\mathcal{A}|)$ | $O(|\theta|)$, depends on feature size |
| **Generalization** | None; state-action specific | Yes; depends on feature design |
| **Scalability** | Poor for large/continuous spaces | Good for large/continuous spaces with proper features |
| **Update Rule** | Direct Q-value update | Parameter update via gradient descent |
| **Convergence** | Guaranteed to optimal $Q^*$ under conditions | Converges to approximation of $Q^*$; depends on features |

## R Implementation

We implement Q-Learning with linear function approximation in a
10-state, 2-action environment, using one-hot encoding for $\phi(s, a)$.
The environment mirrors the previous post, with action 1 yielding a 1.0
reward at the terminal state (state 10) and action 2 yielding 0.5.

**Top-level settings**

```r
n_states <- 10
n_actions <- 2
gamma <- 0.9
terminal_state <- n_states
```

* `n_states` and `n_actions`: size of the MDP (10 states, 2 actions).
* `gamma`: discount factor (0.9).
* `terminal_state`: the index of the terminal state (state 10). Many later pieces use this to stop episodes and to set `q_next = 0` for transitions into terminal.


**Environment: transition and reward models**

```r
set.seed(42)
transition_model <- array(0, dim = c(n_states, n_actions, n_states))
reward_model <- array(0, dim = c(n_states, n_actions, n_states))

for (s in 1:(n_states - 1)) {
  # Action 1: 90% to s+1, 10% to a different random state
  transition_model[s, 1, s + 1] <- 0.9
  other_states <- setdiff(1:n_states, s + 1)
  random_state <- sample(other_states, 1)
  transition_model[s, 1, random_state] <- 0.1
  
  # Action 2: 80% and 20% to two different random states
  two_states <- sample(1:n_states, 2, replace = FALSE)
  transition_model[s, 2, two_states[1]] <- 0.8
  transition_model[s, 2, two_states[2]] <- 0.2
}

# Make terminal state absorbing (stays in itself)
transition_model[n_states, , n_states] <- 1

# Set rewards (fixed, not random each time)
set.seed(42)
for (s in 1:(n_states - 1)) {
  for (a in 1:n_actions) {
    for (s_prime in 1:n_states) {
      if (transition_model[s, a, s_prime] > 0) {
        if (s_prime == n_states) {
          reward_model[s, a, s_prime] <- ifelse(a == 1, 1.0, 0.5)
        } else {
          reward_model[s, a, s_prime] <- ifelse(a == 1, 0.1 * runif(1), 0.05 * runif(1))
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

reward_model[n_states, , ] <- 0
```

* `transition_model[s, a, s']` is the probability of transitioning from state `s` with action `a` to next state `s'`.
* `reward_model[s, a, s']` is the reward received for that transition.

**Key improvements and behavioral details**:

1. **Seeding**: `set.seed(42)` fixes random draws so behavior is reproducible.

2. **Action 1 transitions**:
   * For non-terminal `s`, assigns `0.9` probability to go to `s+1`.
   * Uses `setdiff()` to exclude `s+1` from the random selection, ensuring the 10% probability goes to a **different** state.
   * **Result**: Each row for action 1 correctly sums to 1.0 with exactly two non-zero entries (0.9 and 0.1).

3. **Action 2 transitions**:
   * Uses `sample(1:n_states, 2, replace = FALSE)` to select **two different states**.
   * Assigns 0.8 to the first state and 0.2 to the second.
   * **Result**: Each row for action 2 correctly sums to 1.0 with exactly two non-zero entries, and they're guaranteed to be different states.

4. **Validation check**:
   ```r
   for (s in 1:n_states) {
     for (a in 1:n_actions) {
       prob_sum <- sum(transition_model[s, a, ])
       if (abs(prob_sum - 1.0) > 1e-10) {
         warning(sprintf("State %d, Action %d: probabilities sum to %.4f", s, a, prob_sum))
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   * Validates that all transition probability rows sum to 1.0 (within numerical tolerance).
   * Issues warnings if any row is malformed.

5. **Rewards**:
   * For action 1: if `s'` is terminal reward = `1.0`, else `0.1 * runif(1)` (random small reward).
   * For action 2: terminal reward `0.5`, else `0.05 * runif(1)` (even smaller).
   * **Efficiency improvement**: Rewards are only assigned for reachable states (where `transition_model[s, a, s_prime] > 0`).
   * Rewards are generated once during initialization and remain fixed during training (deterministic environment).

6. **Terminal state**:
   * `transition_model[n_states, , n_states] <- 1` makes terminal state **absorbing** (transitions to itself with probability 1.0).
   * This is the standard MDP formulation for terminal states.
   * `reward_model[n_states, , ] <- 0` ensures no rewards from terminal state.
   * Episodes still end when terminal is reached, so this absorbing property isn't exercised during training.

---

**Sampling function**

```r
sample_env <- function(s, a) {
  probs <- transition_model[s, a, ]
  s_prime <- sample(1:n_states, 1, prob = probs)
  reward <- reward_model[s, a, s_prime]
  list(s_prime = s_prime, reward = reward)
}
```

* Given `(s, a)`, samples `s'` according to the probability vector `probs`.
* Returns a list with `s_prime` and `reward = reward_model[s,a,s_prime]`.
* **Now safe**: Since all transition rows properly sum to 1.0, `sample()` will work correctly without needing to normalize.
* The terminal state absorbing property means if `sample_env(n_states, a)` were called, it would always return `s_prime = n_states`, but episodes terminate before this occurs.

---

**Feature creation (one-hot for (state,action))**

```r
create_features <- function(s, a, n_states, n_actions) {
  vec <- rep(0, n_states * n_actions)
  index <- (a - 1) * n_states + s
  vec[index] <- 1
  return(vec)
}
```

* Creates a one-hot feature vector of length `n_states * n_actions = 20`.
* The mapping `index = (a - 1) * n_states + s` organizes features in action blocks: entries 1-10 for action 1 (states 1-10), entries 11-20 for action 2 (states 1-10).
* Because features are one-hot, linear function approximation `q(s,a) = x^T theta` is mathematically **equivalent to tabular Q-learning** (each `(s,a)` has its own independent weight in `theta`).

---

**Weights and Q-value function**

```r
n_features <- n_states * n_actions
theta <- rep(0, n_features)

q_hat <- function(s, a, theta) {
  x <- create_features(s, a, n_states, n_actions)
  return(sum(x * theta))
}
```

* `theta` holds 20 parameters for the linear approximator; initialized at zeros.
* `q_hat(s,a,theta)` computes Q̂(s,a) = x^T θ. With one-hot `x`, this returns the single `theta` entry corresponding to `(s,a)`.

---

**Q-learning with function approximation**

```r
q_learning_fa <- function(episodes = 1000, alpha = 0.1, epsilon = 0.1) {
  theta <- rep(0, n_features)
  rewards <- numeric(episodes)
  
  for (ep in 1:episodes) {
    s <- sample(1:(n_states - 1), 1)
    episode_reward <- 0
    step_count <- 0
    max_steps <- 1000  # Prevent infinite loops
    
    while (step_count < max_steps) {
      step_count <- step_count + 1
      
      # Epsilon-greedy action selection
      a <- if (runif(1) < epsilon) {
        sample(1:n_actions, 1)
      } else {
        q_vals <- sapply(1:n_actions, function(a_) q_hat(s, a_, theta))
        which.max(q_vals)
      }
      
      out <- sample_env(s, a)
      s_prime <- out$s_prime
      r <- out$reward
      episode_reward <- episode_reward + r
      
      # Compute TD target and error
      q_current <- q_hat(s, a, theta)
      q_next <- if (s_prime == terminal_state) {
        0
      } else {
        max(sapply(1:n_actions, function(a_) q_hat(s_prime, a_, theta)))
      }
      target <- r + gamma * q_next
      error <- target - q_current
      
      # Gradient update
      x <- create_features(s, a, n_states, n_actions)
      theta <- theta + alpha * error * x
      
      if (s_prime == terminal_state) break
      s <- s_prime
    }
    
    rewards[ep] <- episode_reward
  }
  
  # Derive policy
  policy <- sapply(1:n_states, function(s) {
    if (s == terminal_state) {
      NA
    } else {
      which.max(sapply(1:n_actions, function(a) q_hat(s, a, theta)))
    }
  })
  
  list(theta = theta, policy = policy, rewards = rewards)
}
```

**Algorithm details**:

1. **Initialization**: New `theta` vector (zeros) and `rewards` vector to store total reward per episode.

2. **Episode start**: `s <- sample(1:(n_states - 1), 1)` picks a random non-terminal start state.

3. **Safety mechanism**: `max_steps <- 1000` with `step_count` counter prevents infinite loops in case of implementation errors.

4. **Action selection (epsilon-greedy)**:
   * With probability `epsilon = 0.1`, pick a random action (exploration).
   * Otherwise compute Q-values `q_hat(s,a,theta)` for all actions and pick `argmax_a Q(s,a)` (exploitation).
   * Note: `which.max()` returns the first maximum if there's a tie.

5. **Environment interaction**: Call `sample_env(s,a)` to get next state and reward.

6. **TD target and error**:
   * `q_current = Q̂(s,a; θ)`
   * `q_next = 0` if terminal, else `max_a' Q̂(s',a'; θ)`
   * `target = r + γ · q_next`
   * `error = target - q_current` (TD error)

7. **Semi-gradient update**:
   * For linear Q with features `x`, the gradient ∇_θ Q̂(s,a) = x.
   * Update: `θ ← θ + α · error · x`
   * Because `x` is one-hot, only one entry of `θ` changes, making this **equivalent to tabular Q-learning**:
     ```
     θ[s,a] ← θ[s,a] + α(r + γ max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a))
     ```

8. **Episode termination**: Break if `s_prime == terminal_state`; otherwise continue from `s <- s_prime`.

9. **Record episode reward**: Store total episode reward in `rewards[ep]`.

10. **Policy extraction**: After all episodes, derive greedy policy from final `θ`: for each non-terminal state, select `argmax_a Q̂(s,a; θ)`. Terminal state gets `NA`.

**Running the algorithm**

```r
set.seed(42)
fa_result <- q_learning_fa(episodes = 1000, alpha = 0.1, epsilon = 0.1)
fa_policy <- fa_result$policy
fa_rewards <- fa_result$rewards
```

* Trains for 1000 episodes using learning rate `alpha=0.1` and exploration rate `epsilon=0.1`.
* Returns learned `policy`, final `theta` weights, and episode rewards.

**Visualization**

  State = 1:n_states,
  Policy = fa_policy,
  Algorithm = "Q-Learning FA"
)

policy_plot <- ggplot(policy_df[!is.na(policy_df$Policy), ], 
                      aes(x = State, y = Policy)) +

       x = "State", 
       y = "Action") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:n_states) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:n_actions, labels = c("Action 1", "Action 2")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

reward_df <- data.frame(
  Episode = 1:1000,
  CumulativeReward = cumsum(fa_rewards),
  Algorithm = "Q-Learning FA"
)

reward_plot <- ggplot(reward_df, aes(x = Episode, y = CumulativeReward)) +
  geom_line(color = "deepskyblue", linewidth = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Cumulative Rewards Over Episodes",
       x = "Episode",
       y = "Cumulative Reward")

print(policy_plot)
print(reward_plot)
```

**Visualization improvements**:

1. **Policy plot**:
   * Uses `policy_df[!is.na(policy_df$Policy), ]` to filter out the terminal state NA value before plotting.
   * Prevents ggplot2 warnings about missing values.
   * Shows the greedy action (1 or 2) for each non-terminal state as points connected by lines.

2. **Reward plot (NEW)**:
   * Creates and displays cumulative rewards over episodes.
   * Shows learning progress: cumulative reward should increase as the agent learns better policies.
   * Both plots are explicitly printed with `print()`.

3. **Summary statistics (NEW)**:
   ```r
   cat("\nPolicy Summary:\n")
   print(table(fa_policy, useNA = "ifany"))
   
   cat("\nFinal 10 Episode Rewards:\n")
   print(tail(fa_rewards, 10))
   
   cat("\nMean Episode Reward (last 100 episodes):\n")
   print(mean(tail(fa_rewards, 100)))
   ```
   * Provides quantitative analysis of learned policy.
   * Shows distribution of actions across states.
   * Displays recent performance metrics to assess convergence.

**Summary of Corrections**

The corrected code fixes critical bugs in the original implementation:

1. **Transition probabilities now properly sum to 1.0** for all state-action pairs
2. **Terminal state is absorbing** (standard MDP formulation) rather than having zero outgoing probability
3. **Action 2 transitions are guaranteed to be different states** (no accidental overwrites)
4. **Validation checks** ensure environment is well-formed
5. **Safety mechanisms** prevent infinite loops
6. **Complete visualization** with both policy and reward plots
7. **Efficiency improvements** in reward assignment

The algorithm now implements correct tabular Q-learning on a well-defined Markov Decision Process.
